# Preface {-}


<img src="./figures/CoverSol2.png" width="705" />
  

Contained in this volume are the solutions to homework problems in the Computational Probability and Statistics book.  


## Book Structure and How to Use It

This solution manual is setup to match the structure of the accompanying book. 

The learning outcomes for this course are to use computational and mathematical statistical/probabilistic concepts for:

a.	Developing probabilistic models 
b.	Developing statistical models for inference and description
c.	Advancing practical and theoretical analytic experience and skills
